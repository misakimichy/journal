# Journal

#### _Intermediate JavaScript - 9/3/2019_

## Description
Build a Journal website (using Webpack, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery)

Create a journaling website where a user can write entries including at least a title and body.

## Website should have:
- Create `Entry` objects that include a method to return the number of words in the entry.

- Add a separate method (or methods) to return the number of vowels and consonants in each entry.

- Call each of these methods from your front-end file to display their return values.

- Add a method called `getTeaser` to return the first sentence of the entry.
  - If the sentence is over 8 words, only display those first 8 words.

Be sure to call this method from your front-end file to display the results as well, whenever a new journal entry is created.
